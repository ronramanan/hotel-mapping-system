### 🔍 Check Your amplify.yml

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Find `amplify.yml`** (should be in root folder)
3. **Click on it** to view contents
4. **Verify it matches exactly** the code above

**Key things to check:**
- ✅ `baseDirectory: build` (NOT `dist`, NOT `public`)
- ✅ `npm ci` (NOT `npm install`)
- ✅ Correct indentation (YAML is sensitive to spaces)
